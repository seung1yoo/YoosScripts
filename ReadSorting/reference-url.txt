###Align your reads with Novoalign (Illumina)

novoalign -d database.nix -f reads1.fastq -reads2.fastq -oSAM  -i 500 100 | samtools view -bS - alignments

###Filter Alignments for unmapped pairs

#Next up we create three filter categories for:
#1. An unmapped read whose mate is mapped.
#2. A mapped read whoâ€™s mate is unmapped
#3. Both reads of the pair are unmapped
#These categories translate to the following filtering commands:

samtools view -u  -f 4 -F264 alignments.bam  > tmps1.bam
samtools view -u -f 8 -F 260 alignments.bam  > tmps2.bam
samtools view -u -f 12 -F 256 alignments.bam > tmps3.bam

#The above step will work on sorted or unsorted BAM files.
#We then merge these temporary bam files and sort into read name order. The sort is required to get the mates into the correct order.

samtools merge -u - tmps[123].bam | samtools sort -n - unmapped

#Extract the reads in FASTQ format

bamToFastq -bam unmapped.bam -fq1 unmapped_reads1.fastq -fq2 unmapped_reads2.fastq
